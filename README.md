** index.html

This is the main entry point of my portfolio website. It uses semantic HTML5 elements to structure the content, including header, main, and section tags. The header contains my profile picture and introduction. The page links to an external CSS file for styling and a JavaScript file for interactivity.

** style.css

This stylesheet defines the visual presentation of my site. It uses CSS selectors to style elements like the body, header, images, and sections. I applied responsive design principles to ensure the site looks good on different screen sizes. The CSS includes properties for layout, colors, typography, and spacing.

** script.js

This JavaScript file currently contains basic code to log a message to the console. It serves as a placeholder for future enhancements like animations, event handling, or dynamic content updates.

** images/your-profile-picture.jpg

This is the image asset used for my profile picture. It is referenced in the HTML and styled with CSS to appear as a circular avatar.

** images/README.md

This markdown file provides instructions on how to add or update images in the images folder, helping maintain the project.

** favicon.ico

This icon file is linked in the HTML head to display a custom icon in the browser tab, improving branding.

** about.html

This additional HTML page provides more detailed information about my background and skills. It follows the same structure and styling conventions as the main page.

** projects.html

This page lists my projects with descriptions and links. It helps showcase my work and experience.

** contact.html

This page includes a contact form and my contact details. The form uses HTML5 validation and is styled for usability and responsiveness.

Let me know if you want me to provide code snippets or explanations for any specific technical aspects.
